# 📘 IIIT Homework Repository – Probability & Linear Algebra

Welcome to my **IIIT Homework Repository**, where I’ve uploaded two of my Google Colab notebooks focused on **Probability** and **Linear Algebra**.
These notebooks combine **code implementations**, **concept explanations**, **important definitions**, and **key formulas** — all in one place.


## 📂 Repository Overview

This repository contains two main files:

1. **AIML_Course_Probability_Primer.ipynb**

   * Covers core concepts in probability theory.
   * Includes worked-out examples using Python (NumPy, SciPy, Matplotlib,Pandas).
   * Contains definitions, formulas, and visualizations to deepen conceptual understanding.

2. **STP_Linear_Algebra.ipynb**

   * Explains essential topics like matrices, Numpy array, multi_dot method.
   * Demonstrates each topic code snippets and reference video links.
   * Serves as both a reference and a learning notebook.



## 🧠 Learning Goals

* Strengthen understanding of **mathematical foundations** behind AI/ML.
* Bridge the gap between **theory and practical implementation**.
* Build an easy-to-follow reference for revision and quick lookup.



## 🛠️ Tools & Libraries Used

These notebooks are built and executed on **Google Colab** using Python.
Commonly used libraries include:

* `numpy`
* `matplotlib`
* `scipy`
* `pandas`
* `pyplot`



## 🚀 How to Use

1. Open the `.ipynb` files directly in **Google Colab** or **Jupyter Notebook**.
2. Run the cells in order to see the outputs and visualizations.
3. Feel free to modify the code or add your own notes!



## 🧩 Ideal For

* Students learning **Probability** and **Linear Algebra** for AI/ML.
* Anyone looking for a structured blend of **math + code**.
* Quick revision before exams, interviews, or concept refreshers.



## 📜 License

This repository is intended for **educational use only**.
