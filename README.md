# üìò IIIT Homework Repository 

Welcome to my **IIIT Homework Repository**, where I‚Äôve uploaded key Google Colab notebooks from my AI/ML coursework.  
These notebooks combine **concept explanations**, **Python code**, and **visual learning** to connect mathematical foundations with real-world AI applications.

## üìÇ Repository Overview

This repository currently contains **three main modules**:

### 1. AIML_Course_Probability_Primer.ipynb
- Covers **core concepts in probability theory** used in AI/ML.
- Includes worked-out examples using **NumPy, SciPy, Matplotlib, and Pandas**.
- Explains key **definitions, theorems, and visualizations** for deeper understanding.

### 2. STP_Linear_Algebra.ipynb
- Focuses on **essential linear algebra topics** such as:
  - Matrices and matrix operations  
  - `numpy.array`, `multi_dot()`, and matrix multiplication examples  
- Each section includes **code snippets**, **concept notes**, and **reference video links**.
- Serves as both a **learning resource** and a **quick revision guide**.

### 3. Module_01_Lab_01_Feature_Extraction.ipynb
- Introduces the concept of **feature extraction from data**, the foundation of all AI/ML models.
- Demonstrates how to understand and visualize **features in images and text data**.
- Covers examples like:
  - Extracting numerical features (e.g., pixel intensities, edges, histograms)
  - Analyzing written numbers and how features distinguish classes (e.g., digits 0 vs 1)
  - Building visualizations with **Plotly** and **Matplotlib**
- Encourages exploration

## üß† Learning Goals

- Strengthen understanding of **mathematical foundations** behind AI and ML.
- Bridge the gap between **theory and practical coding**.
- Develop the ability to **analyze, extract, and visualize meaningful features** from raw data.
- Build a reusable, easy-to-follow reference for **revision and project preparation**.
